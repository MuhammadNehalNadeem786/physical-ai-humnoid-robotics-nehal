### Recommended for Training
- Headless mode
- Lower render resolution
- Fixed physics timestep

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **GUI** for environment & robot design
- Use **headless mode** for training & batch runs
- Control robots via **ROS 2 topics, services, and actions**
- Keep **simulation and control logic separated**
- Version-control **USD environments**
- Match physics timestep with control loops
